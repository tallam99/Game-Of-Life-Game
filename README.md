# The Game of Life Game

The Game of Life Game is a 3D platformer based on John Conway's Game of Life.
The controls are WASD keys for movement, space bar for jumping, and mouse for camera control.
The goal is to survive on the evolving grid as long as possible, and the score is a multiplicative function of time survived and horizontal distance traveled.
10 custom levels are included based on classic Game of Life oscillators and spaceships.

In the spirit of Game of Life, the melody of the soundtrack was generated using glider configurations.
The live recording of the soundtrack can be viewed [here.](https://youtu.be/nF3_FcRNiag)

Levels are specified by text input files with examples found in the "Level Templates" directory.
To add custom levels, drop level files in the directory appropriate for your OS.
